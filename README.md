DiRT: Drop-in Replacement Textures
==================================
DiRT is a fork of Shaw's TextureReplacer, and is used for substituting textures in Kerbal Space Program. The intent of this fork is to simplify the plugin, removing everything except texture replacement.

### What This Plugin Does
* Replaces in-game textures and normal maps.
* Exports a list of the game's textures to a text file.

### What This Plugin Does Not Do
* Anything else.

Specifically, this plugin does not perform Active Texture Management, does not compress textures, does not convert PNG files to RGB, does not generate MipMaps, and does not allow suits and heads to be mapped to specific kerbals. If you need any of those features, please consider using "Texture Replacer" (which is back in active development).

This plugin does not allow replacement of NavBall textures. For NavBall textures, please consider using "Navball Texture Changer".


Instructions
------------
### Installation
The released zip file includes the following folders and files:

	DiRT\ 
	DiRT\GameData\ 
	DiRT\GameData\DiRT\
	DiRT\GameData\DiRT\DiRT.dll
	DiRT\GameData\DiRT\config.cfg
	DiRT\GameData\DiRT\DiRT.version	
	DiRT\GameData\DiRT\Textures\
	DiRT\Source\
	DiRT\Source\DiRT.cs
	DiRT\Source\DiRTActivator.cs
	DiRT\Source\Replacer.cs
	DiRT\Source\Properties\
	DiRT\Source\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs
	DiRT\README.md

Copy the "DiRT\GameData\DiRT" folder and all of its contents into to the "GameData\" folder of your KSP install.

If you downloaded KSP from the Squad Store or any other direct-download source, this will be the "KSP_win64\GameData\" folder (for Windows), "KSP_osx\GameData\" (for MacOS), or "KSP_linux\GameData\" (for GNU/Linux) created when you installed the game. If you installed the game from Steam, This will be the "steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program\GameData\" folder in whatever location is used by Steam. You can find this by right clicking on the game's name in your library, selecting Properties, going to the Local Files tab, and selecting "BROWSE LOCAL FILES...".

You do not need the files in the Source folder to use the mod. Those are the C# files needed to recompile DiRT from scratch.

### Replacement Textures
Drop your Replacement Textures into the "GameData\DiRT\Textures\" folder.

### Alternate Configs and Texture Packs
In the folder for your mod or your texture pack, create a "config.cfg" file (or any other name provided the file extension is .cfg) containing a "DiRT_Config" node. Inside that node set a "TextureFolder" entry to the GameData folder where your textures are located. Example follows:

	DiRT_Config
	{
		TextureFolder = MyMod/Textures/
	}
	
### Module Manager Support
DiRT texture paths automatically work with Module Manager. If you wish to include a Module Manager configuration for DiRT in your mod instead of the usual configuration file, use the following template:

	@DiRT_Config
	{
		%TextureFolder = MyMod/Textures/
	}

### Exporting Texture Names
Set the "exportTextureNames" entry in the config file to "True". A file will be created in the main DiRT GameData folder named "GameData/DiRT/ExportedTextureList.txt" with a list of textures and their normal maps. This file will be updated once per game launch.


Common Texture Names
--------------------
### SkyBox
* GalaxyTex_NegativeX
* GalaxyTex_PositiveX
* GalaxyTex_PositiveY
* GalaxyTex_NegativeY
* GalaxyTex_NegativeZ
* GalaxyTex_PositiveZ

### Kerbals
These are listed as: "Texture name (Normal Map) - Short description." 
* kerbalHead (?) - Male kerbal head.
* kerbalGirl_06_BaseColor (?) - Female kerbal head.
* whiteSuite_diffuse (orangeSuite_normal) - The new 1.5 EVA suit texture. This is used for both the helmet and body.
* orangeSuite_diffuse (orangeSuite_normal) - The new 1.5 orange IVA suit. This is used for both the helmet and body.
* paleBlueSuite_diffuse (orangeSuite_normal) - The new 1.5 blue IVA suit. This is used for both the helmet and body.
* EVAjetpack (EVAjetpackNRM) - EVA jetpack texture.
* jetpack (EVAjetpackNRM) - Not sure what this is. A new 1.5.x EVA pack? The in-game model still uses the old texture name (EVAjetpack), just with a different mapping.
* me_suit_difuse_orange (kerbalMainNRM) - Making History suit texture. This is used for both the helmet and body.
* me_suit_difuse_blue (kerbalMainNRM) - Making History suit texture. This is used for both the helmet and body.

General Comments
----------------
* I strongly suggest the use of DDS/DXT1 or DDS/DXT5 texture files with pre-generated MipMaps.
* Textures will work best if their size is a power of 2. (Ex: 1024x512) If in doubt, use the resolution of the texture you are replacing. 
* Due to the way KSP and/or Unity uses textures, you must rotate the texture 180 degrees and flip horizontally before saving/exporting.
